# Angular database schema sample

Developer sample written in Angular, demonstrating how to use the Gemini API and
function calling to collaboratively and iteratively create a database schema
using natural language prompts.


Caution: Using the Google AI SDK directly from a client-side app as is shown in
this sample is recommended for prototyping only. For non-prototyping use cases,
we strongly recommend that you call the Google AI Gemini API only server-side to
keep your API key safe. If you embed your API key directly in your web app or
fetch it remotely at runtime, you risk potentially exposing your API key to
malicious actors.


This project was initially generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
